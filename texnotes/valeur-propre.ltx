\section{Introduction}
Let $X$ be a finite graph, which can have loops and multiple edges. We
denote by $X^0$ the set of vertices, by $X^1$ the edges, and by
$\ell^2(X^0)$ the space of functions $X^0 \to \C$ endowed with the
scalar product having for an orthonormal basis the characteristic
functions of the vertices. We also denote by $a_{x,y}$ the number of
edges of $X$ between the two vertices $x, y \in X^0$ and we define the
degree of $x\in X^0$ to be $\deg(x) = \sum_{y \in X^0} a_{x,y}$ (in
particular each loop at $x$ contributes 1 to $\deg(x)$)

The {\em Laplacian} of $X$ is the linear operator $\Delta$ defined on $\ell^2(X^0)$ by

\[ \Delta v(x) = \deg(x) v(x) - \sum_{y \in X^0} a_{x,y} v(y) \]

for every $v\in \ell^2(X^0)$. The operator $\Delta$ is self-adjoint.
Its spectrum is consists only of nonnegative eigenvalues {\em [est
    r\'eel positif]} and contains 0. The kernel of $\Delta$ can be
identified with the locally constant functions on $X^0$, and the
multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is equal to the number of connected
components of $X$. The eigenvalues are numbered taking into account their multiplicities

\[0 = \lambda_1(X) \le \lambda_2(X) \le \cdots \le \lambda_m(X) \]
where $m = |X^0|$. We denote by $\sp(X)$ this spectrum.

If $X$ is connected, we always have $\lambda_2(X) > 0$ and the value of $\lambda_2(X)$ is
is related to geometric properties of $X$ such as its diameter, and vertex and edge expansion.

\noindent {\bf Remark.} If $X$ is a graph with loops, and if $Y$ is
the graph obtained from $X$ by removing all its loops, it follows from the
definition that the Laplacians of $X$ and $Y$ are identical as operators
on $\ell^2(X^0) = \ell^2(Y^0)$.

Let $G$ be a finite group generated by a subset $S$ of $G$ such that
$s \in S \Leftrightarrow s^{-1} \in S$. Suppose moreoever that the
identity $e \in G$ does not belong to $S$. The {\em Cayley graph}
$X(G, S)$ is the graph whose vertices are elements of $G$, and whose
edges are $\{g, gs\}$ for $s\in S$ and $g \in G$. We denote by
$\sum_{g\in G} z_g g$ the element of the algebra $\C[G]$ which
corresponds to the function $g \mapsto z_g : G \to \C$.
The algebra $\C[G]$ is naturally identified with the space $\ell^2(X^0(G, S))$.
%
The Laplacian $\Delta$ of the Cayley graph $X(G, S)$ is therefore an
endomorphism of $\C[G]$ and we can check that $\Delta$ is in fact
right multiplication by the element $\sum_{s\in S}(1 - s)$ in $\C[G]$.
%
We note that the value of $\lambda_2(X(G, S))$ is
related to the Kazhdan constant defined on G and S [BH].

The main goal of the present work is the following result, for Cayley
graphs of Coxeter systems of type $A$.

\begin{theorem}
Let $G$ be the symmetric group on the set $\{1,\ldots, n\}$ and let $S$ be the set of transpositions
$\{(1,2),(2,3),\ldots,(n-1,n)\}$. Then
\[ \lambda_2(X(G,S)) = \cdots = \lambda_n(X(G,S)) = 2 - 2 \cos(\pi / n) \]
\end{theorem}

\section{Preliminaries}
Let $G$ be a group, and $S$ a system of generators as above, and let
$X(G, S)$ be the Cayley graph associated to $G$ and $S$. The algebra
$\C[G]$ admits two natural linear representations of $G$, the left regular representation
\[ \lambda(g) \sum z_h h = \sum z_h(gh) = \sum z_{g^{-1}h} h\]
and the right regular representation
\[ \rho(g) \sum z_h h = \sum z_h(hg^{-1}) = \sum z_{hg} h\]

\begin{proposition}
The eigenspaces of $\Delta$ are invariant with respect to the left regular representation $\lambda$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
This follows from the fact that $\Delta = \rho(\sum_{s\in S} (1-s))$ commutes with $\lambda(g)$ for each $g\in G$. \cqed
\end{proof}

Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. The {\em loopy Schreier graph} $X_\ell(H \sub G, S)$ is the graph whose
vertices are the right cosets $\{ Hg \sub G \st g \in G\}$ of $H$, and whose edges are the pairs $\{ Hg, Hgs \}$ for
each $g \in G, s \in S$.
%
The {\em Schreier graph} $X(H \sub G, S)$ is defined as $X_\ell(H \sub G, S)$ with all loops removed.
%
The Schreier graph is the graph associated with the ``equitable
partition'' obtained by considering right cosets, in the sense of
[Mo].

By abuse of notation we use $\rho$ to denote the natural right action of $G$ on $X^0(H \sub G, S)$.
From what was said in the introduction, it follows that the Laplacian of $X(H \sub G, S)$ is identical to
the operator $\rho(\sum_{S\in S}(1 - s))$ on $\ell^2(X^0(H \sub G, S))$.

\begin{lemma}
If $K$ and $H$ are subgroups of $G$ with $K \sub H \sub G$ then
\[ \lambda \in \sp(X(H\sub G, S)) \imp \lambda \in \sp(X(K\sub G, S))\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For a subgroup $H$ of $G$, the functions on $X^0(H\sub G, S)$
can be identified with those of the right ideal $(\sum_{h\in H}h)\C[G]$ of $\C[G]$.
The operator $\Delta$ preserves this ideal. For two subgroups $K \sub H$ of $G$,
we have $(\sum_{h\in H} h)\C[G] \sub (\sum_{k\in K} k)\C[G]$.
\cqed
\end{proof}

\section{Description of the Schreier graph}
In the sequel we will take the set of generators $S$ of the symmetric group $S_n$ to be the set of transpositions
\[(1,2), (2, 3), \ldots, (n-1, n)\]
We consider the {\em right} action of $S_n$ on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. We write
$(i)\cdot g$ for the image of $i \in \{1,\ldots, n\}$ under the right action of $g\in S_n$.
For example let $s$ be the permutation $\left( {1 \atop 3} {2\atop 5} {3\atop 1}{4\atop 2}{5\atop 4} \right)$.
and let $t$ be the permutation $\left( {1 \atop 3} {2\atop 4} {3\atop 2}{4\atop 1}{5\atop 5} \right)$,
Then $(1)\cdot st = 2$, $(2)\cdot st = 5$, $(3)\cdot st = 3$, $(4)\cdot st = 4$, $(5)\cdot st = 1$, i.e.
$st$ is the permutation $\left( {1 \atop 2} {2\atop 5} {3\atop 3}{4\atop 4}{5\atop 1} \right)$.

We choose an integer $k$ such that $0 \le k < n$. We identify $S_k$ with the subgroup of $S_n$ consisting
of the permutations that fix the elements $\{k+1, \ldots, n\}$.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop.schreier}
The Schreier graph $X(S_k \sub S_n, S)$ is isomorphic to the graph defined as follows. The set of vertices is
\[X^0 = \{(a_{k+1}, \ldots, a_n) \in \{1,\ldots, n\}^{n-k} \st i\ne j \imp a_i \ne a_j\}\]
The set of edges is a disjoint union $X^1 = X^1_1 \sqcup X^1_2$; two vertices
$a = (a_{k+1}, \ldots, a_n)$ and $b = (b_{k+1}, \ldots, b_n)$ are connected by an edge
in $X^1_1$ if
\[ \sum (a_i - b_i)^2 = 1\]
and they are connected by an edge in $X^1_2$ if there exist $i,j \in [k+1, n]$ and $\ell \in [1,n-1]$ such that
\[ a_s = b_s \qquad (\forall s \not\in\{ i,j\}) \]
and
\[ a_i = b_j = \ell \qquad\qquad a_j = b_i = \ell + 1\]
In particular, $a$ and $b$ are exchanged by the reflection of $\R^{n-k}$ that fixes the solutions
of the equation $x_i = x_j$.
\end{proposition}
For a vertex $a = (a_{k+1}, \ldots, a_n)$ of $X(S_k \sub S_n, S)$ we call the $a_i$ the coordinates of $a$.
Before giving the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop.schreier}, we can illustrate it with an example in Figure~\ref{schreier}.

\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
  Let $g, h\in S_n$ be given. Given the inclusion $S_k \sub S_n$ noted above, we have
\[ S_k g = S_k h \quad \Leftrightarrow\quad \forall i \in \{k+1, \ldots, n\} . (i) \cdot g = (i) \cdot h \]
Hence the function $S_n \to X^0$ defined by $g \mapsto ((k+1) \cdot g), \ldots, (n) \cdot g)$ lifts
to the quotient and defines a bijection $S_n / S_k \to X^0$.

It remains sto see that $X^1$ is the set of edges. Let $a = (a_{k+1}, \ldots, a_n) \in X^0$.
We have $i \cdot g = a_i$ for $k+1 \le i \le n$ and for any $g$ in the equivalence class represented by $a$.
We need to calculate the right coset in $S_n / S_k$ of $gs$ for $s \in S$.

Let $\ell$ be given with $1 \le \ell \le n-1$ and let $s$ be the transposition $(\ell, \ell+1)$.
There are three cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Neither $\ell$ nor $\ell+1$ are in the set of coordinates of $a$
\item One of the two is in the set of coordinates of $a$
\item Both are in set of coordinates of $a$
\end{enumerate}
We treat these cases as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We have
\[ ((i)\cdot g)\cdot s = a_i \cdot s = a_i \]
because $a_i \ne \ell, \ell+1$ for $i \in [k+1, n]$. There is no edge because $g$ and $gs$ are in the same equivalence class.
\item Let $j \in [k+1, n]$ be given such that $a_j = \ell$. The equivalence class of $g$ is represented by
\[ [g] = (a_{k+1}, \ldots a_{j-1}, \ell, a_{j+1}, \ldots, a_n)\]
and for $h \in [k+1,n]$ with $h\ne j$ we have
\[(h)\cdot(gs) = a_h\]
because then $a_h \ne \ell, \ell+1$. For $j$ we get
\[ (j) \cdot (gs) = \ell \cdot s = \ell+1\]
The class of $gs$ is represented by the vertex $(a_{k+1}, \ldots, a_{j-1}, \ell+1, a_{j+1}, \ldots, a_n)$
and we have an edge of type $X^1_1$. The case of $a_j = \ell + 1$ is analogous.
\item Let $i,j\in [k+1, n]$ such that $a_i = \ell$ and $a_j = \ell + 1$. For $h \in [k+1,n]$ with
$h \not\in \{i,j\}$, we have
\[(h) \cdot(gs) = a_h\]
For $i$ and $j$ we have
\[(i)\cdot(gs) = \ell \cdot s = \ell + 1 \qquad (j)\cdot(gs) = (\ell+1)\cdot s = \ell\]
so we have an edge of type $X^1_2$. \cqed
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

{\bf Remark.} There are $n\choose k$ ``obvious'' embeddings (up to an
interior automorphism of $S_k$) of $S_k$ into $S_n$. These correspond
to a choice of subset of $k$ of the $n$ elements on which $S_k$
acts in the evident way, and which acts trivially on the other elements.
For each of these embeddings the graph
$X(S_k \sub S_n, S)$ is isomorphic (as an abstract graph) to the graph
described by Proposition~\ref{prop.schreier}. This can be seen by
taking the above proof and modifying it to consider instead the restriction
of $S_k g$ to the set $\{1, \ldots, \hat i_1, \ldots, \hat i_k, \ldots, n\}$
 where $\{i_1, \ldots, i_k\}$ is the set of elements
on which $S_k$ acts non-trivially.

Here, as a corollary, is a description of the Cayley graph $X(S_n, S)$:

\begin{proposition}
The Cayley graph $X(S_n, S)$ is given by:
\[X^0 = \{(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in [1,n]^n \st i \ne j \imp a_i \ne a_j\}\]
\[X^1 = \{\{a,b\} \subseteq X^0 \st d(a, b) = \sqrt{2}\}\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
There are no edges of type $X^1_1$ in the sense of the preceding proposition, and two vertices of $X(S_n, S)$ are connected
by an edge of type $X^1_2$ iff the Euclidean distance between them is $\sqrt{2}$.
  \cqed
\end{proof}
