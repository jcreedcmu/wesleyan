\subsubsection*{Morse Theory}

Let me try to page back in that very old line of thinking about
polynomials and visual representations of $n$-cells, perhaps in a more
principled way this time.

Suppose an interval $[0,1]$ is mapped by $f$ to real numbers in some smooth fashion. Every
point is positive or negative or zero. By intermediate value theorem, if I look
at a point $x$ and $f(x)$ is positive, and I look some distance away at $x'$,
and I know no `critical' points (by which I mean $f(x)$ being zero) occur in between
$x$ and $x'$, then $f(x')$ is also positive.

Given an interval mapped to real numbers, I can ask for the
topological space of critical points of it; it'll be a discrete
collection of points. Let's call these $1$-critical points
specifically. They represent a $1$-cell transition from one object of
a category to another. The criterion for being $1$-critical is simply that $f(x) = 0$.

Now consider a square $[0,1]^2$. Suppose we call the coordinates $x$ and $y$. For
each particular $y$, we have a set of $1$-critical points. As we increase $y$,
the topology of this set may change, as we pass through a $2$-critical point.

Contrapositively, I'd like to be able to prove a lemma that says
\begin{lemma}
Let $f : [0,1]^2 \to \R$. If there are no 2-critical points in $f$,
then the 1-critical points of $f(\dash, 0)$ are homeomorphic to those of $f(\dash, 1)$.
\end{lemma}
and in fact there should be a nice unique lifting that tells us how to transport
any critical point in $f(\dash, 0)$ down to $f(\dash, 1)$.

So what are 2-critical points? I suppose anything for which $f = 0$ and $f_x = 0$.

Ok, let's establish some more basic claims:

\begin{lemma}
If $f(x,y) \ne 0$, then there's a neighborhood around $(x,y)$ that contains no critical points at all.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Follows directly from continuity of $f$. Such a point represents an {\em object} of the underlying category.
\cqed
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
If $f(x,y) = 0$ and $f_x(x,y) \ne 0$, then there's a neighborhood around $(x,y)$ that contains no 2-critical points.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Follows directly from continuity of $f_x$. Such a point represents an {\em morphism} of the underlying category.
\cqed
\end{proof}

Here's a harder one:
\vfil\eject
\begin{lemma}
If
\[ f = 0\qquad f_x = 0\qquad f_{xx} > 0\qquad f_y > 0\]
then there exists a neighborhood $[x_-, x_+] \x [y_-, y_+]$ around $(x,y)$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item
There are no critical points in $[x_-, x_+] \x (y,y_+)$.
\item
There are exactly two 1-critical points in
$[x_-, x_+] \x \{y'\}$, for any $y' \in (y_-, y)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By continuity, $f_y > 0$ and $f_{xx} > 0$ at the point $(x,y)$ means we can assume a sufficiently
small region to ensure that those hold throughout the region.



\cqed
\end{proof}
