\section{Thinking About A Small Example}

Let's just do some ordinary category theory about the case where
I have just a single-arrow category $f : 0 \to 1$. Then transport
looks like
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
A_{01} \arrow[r, "0f"] \arrow[d, "f1"'] & A_{00} \arrow[d, "f0"] \\
A_{11} \arrow[r, "1f"'] & A_{10}
\end{tikzcd}
\]
where $A : \C \x \C^\op \to \rset$. The type $A \to B$ has object
part $(A \to B)_\delta = A_{\bar\delta} \to B_\delta$ so that transport works at all.
A closed term at a type is a natural transformation from the hom-type
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & 1 \arrow[d] \\
1 \arrow[r] & 1
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Products should work pointwise, I should think? Then surely $A \x 1 = A$.
Do I also get that $1 \imp A = A$? Sure. $1_{\bar \delta} \to A_{\delta}$ is still
$A_{\delta}$. But {\em morphisms} from the hom-type are something else.
$H_{\bar\delta} \to A_\delta$ means that we take everything at $A_{10}$ and replace
it with a single unique point. So some kind of non-truthvalue-centric modality?

Consider the type $A \to A$. We can make a term of it by
taking the identity functions  $A_{00} \to A_{00}$ and $A_{11} \to A_{11}$,
and observing that their common transport to $A_{01} \to A_{10}$ is just
either trip around the transport diamond of $A$ itself.

Consider the composition type $(A \to B) \to (B \to C) \to A \to C$.
We can pick
\[(A_{00} \to B_{00}) \to (B_{00} \to C_{00}) \to A_{00} \to C_{00}\]
\[(A_{11} \to B_{11}) \to (B_{11} \to C_{11}) \to A_{11} \to C_{11}\]
to be actual composition, and then from these we derive
\[(A_{10} \to B_{01}) \to (B_{10} \to C_{01}) \to A_{01} \to C_{10}\]
In which an element from $A_{01}$ is transported down (in one of two
equivalent ways) to $A_{10}$, lifted back up to $B_{01}$ by the first
argument, transported back down to $B_{10}$ (in one of two
equivalent ways) lifted back up to $C_{01}$ by the second argument,
then finally transported down to $C_{10}$ (in one of two
equivalent ways). So yeah, composition is definable as a term.

\subsection{Some more generality}

Let's say we have a category $\C$ with an involutive contravariant endofunctor
$\star : \C^\op \to \C$. We aim to define a sort of `twisted presheaf' with
respect to $\star$. The objects of the putative category of twisted presheaves
is just functors $\C \to \rset$, but the morphisms will be nonstandard.

We can define $F \imp G$ to be the objectwise function space from $F \o \star$ to $G$.
That is, for any $C, D$, and $f : C \to D$, we have
\[(F \imp G)_C = F_{\star C} \to G_C\]
and
\[(F \imp G)_f = \lambda h : F_{\star C} \to G_C . \lambda d : F_{\star D} . G_f (h (F_{\star f} d))\]

We want something to play the role of the homfunctor $H : \C \to \C^\op \to \rset$
so that we can say a morphism $F \to G : \TP$ is a natural tranformation
$\rset^\C[H , F \imp G]$.

\subsection{Wait a minute What about composition}

Forget about the generality above for now, go back to the concrete case where I am
talking about $\C^\op \x \C$, not some general case where I have a category-
with-involution. It looks like I can't define normal things like application
or composition across several closed terms, even though I can make closed
terms with fairly rich behavior when application or composition is internalized!
So maybe this is a place where I can see how I need to generalize what a term is,
to get a better-situated induction hypothesis.

Let me expand on what I just said with examples: There is always a closed
term $(A \to B) \to (B \to C) \to A \to C$, as I described farther above.
Even more simply, there is always a closed term at $A \to (A \to B) \to B$.
For I say
\[t_0 : A_{00} \to (A_{00} \to B_{00}) \to B_{00}\]
\[t_1 : A_{11} \to (A_{11} \to B_{11}) \to B_{11}\]
are the application functions at each individual type, and observe that transport
along $f : 0 \to 1$
to
\[A_{01} \to (A_{10} \to B_{01}) \to B_{10}\]
which gives me either
(repeatedly using
$ (A \to B)_{\phi}(h) = \lambda x . B_{\phi} ( h(A_{\bar\phi} x))$)
\[ (A \to (A \to B) \to B)_{f0}(t_0) = \lambda a . ((A \to B) \to B)_{f0} ( t_0(A_{0f} a)) \]
\[= \lambda a . ((A \to B) \to B)_{f0} ( t_0(A_{0f} a)) \]
\[= \lambda a g . B_{f0} ( t_0(A_{0f} a, (A \to B)_{0f} g)) \]
\[= \lambda a g . B_{f0} ( t_0(A_{0f} a, \lambda x . B_{0f} ( g(A_{f0} x))))\]
\[= \lambda a g . B_{f0} (  B_{0f} ( g(A_{f0} A_{0f} a))))\]
\[= \lambda a g . B_{ff} ( g(A_{ff} a))\]
or symmetrically
\[ (A \to (A \to B) \to B)_{1f}(t_1) = \lambda a g . B_{ff} ( g(A_{ff} a))\]

However, suppose I have a closed term $M : A$ and $N : A \to B$.
This means I have all of
\[M_0 : A_{00} \qquad N_0 : A_{00} \to B_{00}\]
\[M_1 : A_{11} \qquad N_1 : A_{11} \to B_{11}\]
\[A_{f0} M_0 = A_{1f} M_1 \qquad
\forall x : A_{01} . B_{f0} ( N_0(A_{0f} x)) = B_{1f} ( N_0(A_{f1} x))\]
So I can make the raw data of a term $L = N M : B$ via
\[L_0 : B_{00} = N_0\ M_0 \qquad L_1 : B_{11} = N_1\ M_1\]
But I don't seem to be able to prove
\[B_{f0} (N_0(M_0)) = B_{1f} (N_1(M_1))\]
Because, on one side of the symmetric coin, $M_0$ is not of the form $A_{f0}$ of something.

Here's a na\"ive conjecture I hope I can refute: that we can get away with thinking
of terms as global sections, which is to say, a term of $A$ is just
picking out an element of $A_{01}$. For is there even an element of
\[(A_{01} \to B_{10}) \to (B_{01} \to C_{10}) \to A_{10} \to C_{01}\]
? It doesn't seem like it! I wouldn't know how to get from $B_{10}$ to $B_{01}$!
So that's a good signal that something interestingly
nontrivial is going on here, but I still don't
know what.

\subsubsection{A Guess}

What if I try to deliberately move away from the closedness of terms, by
saying: a term of type $A$ is a choice, for every type $\Gamma$, of
a closed term of the function type $\Gamma \to A$. Then can I prove
something like cut/substitution? I'd have $\Gamma \to A$ and
$\Gamma \to A \to B$ for every $\Gamma$. I want to prove $\Gamma \to B$
for every $\Gamma$. Is there a clever {\em choice} of $\Gamma$ for
the premises derived from the universal $\Gamma$ in my conclusion?
Hmm, don't see how. Any use of existentially quantifying over the $\Gamma$s?
Nah, that makes a term at every type.

\subsubsection{End Formulation}

The thing I failed to check is simply that if I have

\[M \in \int_{c \in \C} A_{cc} \to B_{cc} \qquad
N \in \int_{c \in \C} A_{cc}\]

it isn't obvious how to get

\[M\ N \in \int_{c \in \C} B_{cc}\]

Because the object part is easy; $(M\ N)_c = M_c\ N_c$.
But I need to check that $B_{fc} (M\ N)_c = B_{df} (M\ N)_d$,
that is, $B_{fc} (M_c\ N_c) = B_{df} (M_d\ N_d)$.
What I know is that $A_{fc} N_c = A_{df} N_d$
and $(A \to B)_{fc} M_c = (A \to B)_{df} M_d$, the latter which means
\[B_{fc} (M_c(A_{cf} x)) = B_{df} (M_d(A_{fd} x))\]

\subsection{Composition With Half-Mute Functors}

Let's reassure myself that things don't unravel all the way back to
last November. If we have {\em covariant} functors $A, B, C$, and ends
\[M \in \int_c A(c) \to B(c) \]
\[N \in \int_c B(c) \to C(c) \]
Then surely there is a composite, yeah? Because $M$ actually is a natural
transformation $A \to B$ and $N$ a natural transformation $B \to C$.
If $\C$ were just a single arrow $f : c \to d$, then the general
diagram of $A \to B$
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
A_{dc} \to B_{cd} \arrow[r, "cf"] \arrow[d, "fd"'] & A_{cc} \to B_{cc} \arrow[d, "fc"] \\
A_{dd}\to B_{dd} \arrow[r, "df"'] & A_{cd} \to B_{dc}
\end{tikzcd}
\]
would degenerate to
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
A_{d} \to B_{c} \arrow[r, "cf"] \arrow[d, "fd"'] & A_{c} \to B_{c} \arrow[d, "fc"] \\
A_{d}\to B_{d} \arrow[r, "df"'] & A_{c} \to B_{d}
\end{tikzcd}
\]

Then how do we form the composite? To get from $A_d \to C_d$ we go $A_d \to B_d \to C_d$,
and same with $c$. What's the condition we need to check? That
$A_c \to A_d \to B_d \to C_d$ is the same as $A_c \to B_c \to C_c \to C_d$.
But we get this one type at a time. It's just chasing the diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
A_{c}  \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & B_{c}  \arrow[d] \ar[r] & C_{c}  \arrow[d] \\
A_{d} \arrow[r] & B_{d} \ar[r] & C_{d}
\end{tikzcd}
\]

Why can't we do
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
A_{cd}  \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & B_{cd}  \arrow[d] \ar[r] & C_{cd}  \arrow[d] \\
A_{dc} \arrow[r] & B_{dc} \ar[r] & C_{dc}
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Because we don't actually have functions $A_{cd} \to B_{cd} \to C_{cd}$.

\subsection{Slightly Less Nontrivial Example?}

It's still weirding me out that dinatural transformations can't be composed, and
yet I don't know of any proposition that can't be realized with a proof term for
its corresponding type.

Like, suppose $A, B, C, D, E, F, Y, Z$ are $\C \x \C^\op \to \rset$. It's meaningful
for me to write
\[ A \to (((A \to B + C) \to (B \to D \x E) \to (C \to F) \to (E + F \to Z) \to Z) \to Y) \to Y\]
where $+$ and $\x$ mean pointwise sum and product, and
$(A \to B)_\delta = A_{\bar\delta} \to B_{\delta}$ with evident transport.
Is there an element of the end of this functor? I think so. For I can surely realize
\[ A_d \to (((A_d \to B_d + C_d) \to (B_d \to D_d \x E_d) \to (C_d \to F_d) \to (E_d + F_d \to Z_d) \to Z_d) \to Y_d) \to Y_d\]
for every symmetric $d$, as
\[ \lambda ak . k (\lambda \alpha\beta\gamma\zeta. \bcase \alpha\ a \bof\]
\[b \to \zeta (\binl (\bsnd \beta\ b) ) \celse c \to  \zeta (\binr (\gamma\ c)))\]
and we'd want to check that transport works out the same either way, which results in
\[ A_{\bar\delta} \to (((A_{\delta} \to B_{\bar\delta} + C_{\bar\delta}) \to (B_{\delta} \to D_{\bar\delta} \x E_{\bar\delta}) \to (C_{\delta} \to F_{\bar\delta}) \to (E_{\delta} + F_{\delta} \to Z_{\bar\delta}) \to Z_{\delta}) \to Y_{\bar\delta}) \to Y_{\delta}\]

which does the same thing with some coercions slipped in. We take in a
$A_{\bar\delta}$, convert it to $A_\delta$, feed it to the function
spitting out the $B_{\bar\delta}+C_{\bar\delta}$, convert its
components, etc. etc.

What's going on here? How is this compositional? It sure looks like
some kind of term/anti-term business going on. I can `prove' $Y \to Y$
because the two ways of going $Y_{\bar\delta} \to Y_\delta$ are the
same, because that functoriality is part of what it means for $Y$ to be a type.

Strawman proposal: variables act like knowledge that global sections of a functor exist,
but what we're proving is merely ends. The substitution theorem says that if we have a natural
transformation
$M_{\delta} : \Gamma_{\delta} \to  A_\delta$ and a term
\[N : \int \Gamma_{\bar\delta} \to A_{\bar \delta} \to B_\delta\] then
we have a term
\[[M/x]N : \int \Gamma_{\bar\delta} \to B_\delta\]
How does this work? We have to come up with
\[([M/x]N)_d :  \Gamma_{dd} \to B_{dd}\]
so we set
\[([M/x]N)_d(g) = N_d(g, M_{dd}(g))\]
Great, what about the end condition? Let a morphism $f : d \to e$ be given.
We want to confirm that
\[(\Gamma \to B)_{fd} ([M/x]N)_d = (\Gamma \to B)_{ef}([M/x]N)_e \]
\[(\Gamma \to B)_{fd} \lambda g . N_d(g, M_{dd}(g)) = (\Gamma \to B)_{ef} \lambda g . N_e(g, M_{ee}(g)) \]
\[(g : \Gamma_{de}) \to  B_{fd}  N_d(\Gamma_{df} g, M_{dd}(\Gamma_{df} g)) =  B_{ef}  N_e(\Gamma_{fe} g, M_{ee}(\Gamma_{fe} g)) : B_{ed}\]
Now: we assumed that $M$ works globally, so $M_{de}$ exists, and moreover
naturality means
\[(g : \Gamma_{de})\to  A_{df} M_{de}(g) = M_{dd}(\Gamma_{df} g) : A_{dd}\]
\[(g : \Gamma_{de})\to  A_{fe} M_{de}(g) = M_{ee}(\Gamma_{fe} g) : A_{ee}\]
so our obligation is now to check
\[(g : \Gamma_{de}) \to  B_{fd}  N_d(\Gamma_{df} g, A_{df} M_{de}(g)) =  B_{ef}  N_e(\Gamma_{fe} g, A_{fe} M_{de}(g)) : B_{ed}\]
but this is just the end condition for the type $N$ and we're done.

\subsection{Thought}

What's a concrete example of why I can't require global sections generally?
How about the identity type? Is there always an
element $A_{\bar \delta} \to A_\delta$ for any $A : \C \x \C^\op \to \rset$ and
$\delta : \C \x \C^\op$? I don't believe so. I might consider
specifically the homtype
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & 1 \arrow[d] \\
1 \arrow[r] & 1
\end{tikzcd}
\]
in which there definitely isn't a map $0 \to 1$, even though there is a
term that takes $1 \to 1$ three different ways.

\subsection{If I can't handle cut...}

If my goal is simply to show that if ordinary sequent calculus proves a proposition,
then it's semantically realizable, I shouldn't need to separately worry about cut,
it should just fall out. But I do need to be concerned over particular inference
rules. So I expect ${\imp} L$ to cause the most cut-like obstacles.
\[
\erule
{\Gamma, B \prov C  \qquad \Gamma \prov A}
{\Gamma, A \imp B \prov C}
\]
Let's take even the special case where $\Gamma$ is empty.
Suppose I have $h : B_{dd} \to C_{dd}$, and $a : A_{dd}$,
and I want to make $(A_{dd} \to B_{dd}) \to C_{dd}$. I can certainly form
$\lambda k . h\ (k\ a)$, and then consider transport:
I should require that the two derived ways of doing
$(A_{ed} \to B_{de}) \to C_{ed}$ are the same, given an $f : d \to e$.
They are
\[\lambda k . C_{fd}(h\ (B_{df}(k\ A_{fd} a)))\]
\[\lambda k . C_{ef}(h\ (B_{fe}(k\ A_{ef} a)))\]
Ok, so right off the bat I notice that I {\em want} to be able to identify
$B_{df}(k\ A_{fd} a)$ with $B_{fe}(k\ A_{ef} a)$ but the obstacle is the fact that
I don't know the relationship between $A_{fd} a$ and $A_{ef} a$. Or, rather, I sort
of {\em do}; I know that they've diverged from the peak of the diamond down to the sides,
and I know that {\em if} I made them converge again with... wait, no, I have this wrong.

Both of these have type $(A_{ed} \to B_{de}) \to C_{ed}$:
\[a : A_{dd}, h : B_{dd} \to C_{dd} \prov \lambda k . C_{fd}(h\ (B_{df}(k\ A_{fd} a)))  \]
\[a' : A_{ee}, h' : B_{ee} \to C_{ee} \prov \lambda k . C_{ef}(h'\ (B_{fe}(k\ A_{ef} a')))\]

That means that $A_{fd} a$ and $A_{ef} a'$ {\em are} equal. Let me call them both $\alpha$.
So I'm comparing
\[\alpha : A_{ed}, h : B_{dd} \to C_{dd} \prov \lambda k . C_{fd}(h\ (B_{df}(k\ \alpha)))  \]
\[\alpha : A_{ed}, h' : B_{ee} \to C_{ee} \prov \lambda k . C_{ef}(h'\ (B_{fe}(k\ \alpha)))\]

Now I see it's actually $B$ that's doing the divergent transport,
feeding things to $h$ and $h'$ respectively. But wait, the equality I need
now follows directly from the end-property of $h$, doesn't it?

\subsection{Does It Work For General Contexts?}

Suppose I have terms
$\Gamma \prov M : A$
$\Gamma, x : B \prov N : C$
meaning
\[ M \in \int \Gamma_{\bar\delta} \to A_{\delta}
\qquad N \in \int \Gamma_{\bar\delta} \to B_{\bar\delta} \to C_{\delta}
\]
Then I want to construct a term
\[
P \in \int (A_{\delta} \to B_{\bar\delta}) \to C_{\delta}
\]
by setting $P_d = \lambda k : A_{dd} \to B_{dd} . \ldots$ maybe it's agda time.

Yeah, this checks out in agda. So what's the deal? I can pretty much derive cut from
this and ${\imp}R$, which has to succeed because it's just a mute currying operation.
So do I fail at the step of going from
\[ \int (A_\delta \to A_{\bar \delta}) \to C_\delta \]
to
\[ \int  C_\delta \]
maybe?

Let me focus again on the alleged general failure of getting from
$ M : \int A_{\bar\delta} \to B_{\delta}$ and $N : \int A_{\delta}$
to $P : \int  B_\delta $. We write down that $P_d = M_d(N_d)$.
We want to check that $B_{fd} P_d = B_{ef} P_e$. This means checking
$B_{fd} M_d(N_d) = B_{ef} M_e(N_e)$. We know that
\[A_{fd} N_d = A_{ef} N_e\]
\[(x : A_{de}) \to B_{fd} M_d(A_{df} x) = B_{ef} M_e(A_{fe} x)\]

\subsection{An Interesting Counterexample}

Ok, here's a concrete way in which the semantics is {\em incomplete} with respect to the usual
sequent calculus. It's basically a `yes' to the above question of
\begin{quote}
  Is the essential failure of trying to show cut elimination reducible
  to the specific failure of a cut $\prov A \to A$ against $A \to A
  \prov C$ to get $\prov C$?
\end{quote}

Let $A$ be the homtype
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & 1 \arrow[d] \\
1 \arrow[r] & 1
\end{tikzcd}
\]
and let $C$ be the `inconsistent type 2'
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & \{b\} \arrow[d] \\
\{a\} \arrow[r] & \{a, b\}
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Note
that $C$ has no closed terms.

However, $(A \to A) \to C$ does have a closed term:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  & \lambda \_ . b \arrow[d, mapsto] \\
\lambda \_  . a \arrow[r, mapsto] & !
\end{tikzcd}
\]
The two representatives at each
$((A \to A) \to C)_{dd}$ ignore their argument (the unique function $\{*\} \to \{*\}$) and
produce unique element of $C_{dd}$. Unlike terms of $C$, they {\em do} consistently reconcile
to the same element of $(A_{ed} \to A_{de}) \to C_{ed}$, however, because there
{\em are} no elements of $(A_{ed} \to A_{de})$.

How do I diagnose what the problem is here? Ideally I'd like to say
that, in some way, this exotic term of type $(A \to A) \to C$ is `not
respecting the equality at $A \to A$'.

\subsection{Back to the time when I was thinking about Zig-zags}

So I am stuck pretty hard, aren't I? I'm trying to reconcile the fact that
syntactically it seems like I ought to have
\[ \forall \alpha . A(\alpha) , \forall \alpha . A(\bar\alpha) \to B(\alpha) \prov \forall \alpha . B(\alpha) \]
But generally there doesn't seem to be a function

\[ \left( \int_\delta A_\delta\right) \to \left( \int_\delta A_{\bar\delta} \to B_\delta \right) \to \left( \int_\delta B_\delta\right) \]
the counterexample being when $B$ is the `inconsistent pair' functor $\C \x \C^\op \to \rset$
for $\C$ the one-arrow category, and $A$ is the `homtype'. In this case
$\left( \int_\delta A_\delta\right)$ is singleton, and
$\left( \int_\delta A_{\bar\delta} \to B_\delta \right)$ is singleton, but
$\left( \int_\delta B_\delta\right)$ is empty.

I would try to construct the element of $\int_\delta B_\delta$ from
\[ M \in \int_\delta A_\delta \qquad N \in \int_\delta A_{\bar\delta} \to B_\delta \]

by letting $d$ be given, and constructing $N_d\ M_d : B_{dd}$, and
experiencing the now-familiar failure of verifying the end condition
for this from the end-conditions for $M$ and $N$.

Is $\int_d$ more like $\Diamond \forall$ than a naked $\forall$?
Does
\[ \left( \int_\delta A_\delta\right) \to \left( \int_\delta  B_\delta \right) \to \left( \int_\delta A_\delta \x B_\delta\right) \]
also fail? Here we'd take
\[ M \in \int_\delta A_\delta \qquad N \in \int_\delta  B_\delta \]
and construct $\pair {M_{d}} {N_d} : A_{dd} \x B_{dd}$. We'd want to check that
\[(A \x B)_{fd} \pair {M_{d}} {N_d} = (A \x B)_{ef} \pair {M_{e}} {N_e}\]
\[ \pair{A_{fd}M_{d}}{B_{fd}N_{d}} = \pair{A_{ef}M_{e}}{B_{ef}N_{e}}\]
but this {\em does} follow from the end-properties for $M, N$.
So the real failure must be contained in merely
\[ \left( \int_\delta A_\delta \x  (A_{\bar\delta} \to  B_\delta) \right) \to \left( \int_\delta B_\delta\right) \]
Ok, so again, suppose $A_{de} = \emptyset$ and otherwise $A_\delta = \{*\}$.
Suppose $B_{ed} = \{d, e\}$ and $B_{dd} = \{d\}$ and $B_{ee} = \{e\}$ and $B_{de} = \emptyset$.
We observe that $\int_\delta B_\delta = \emptyset$. We have
\[ A_{de} \x (A_{ed} \to B_{de}) = \emptyset \]
\[ A_{dd} \x (A_{dd} \to B_{dd}) = \{ d \} \]
\[ A_{ee} \x (A_{ee} \to B_{ee}) = \{ e \} \]
\[ A_{ed} \x (A_{de} \to B_{ed}) = \{ * \} \x (\emptyset \to \{d, e\}) = \{ ! \} \]
And there {\em are} terms of this.
