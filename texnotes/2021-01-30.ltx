\section{Main}

Still trying to formulate a good topological definition of higher-dimensional trees.
\subsection{Attempt 21}

Fix an $n\in \N$. Take countably many copies of the unit interval $\I = [0,1]$ and name them $\I_0, \I_1, \ldots $.
Define
\[ L_m = \prod_{i = 0}^{m-1} \I_i \qquad R_m = \prod_{i = m}^{n-1} \I_i \]
so that canonically $\I^n \cong L_m \x R_m$.
We write $\pi_m : \I^n \to \I_m$ and $\pi_{\ge m} : \I^n \to R_m$ for the evident projections.
We say $\pi_i x = 0$ in the `out of bounds' case when $x \in \I^n$ and $i \ge n$.

If $p :X \to Y$ and $g,h : W \to X$ are morphisms in $\Top$ we write $g =_p h$ (`$p$ equalizes $g,h$') if $p g = p h$.

Given maps $p : X \to Y$ and $f : X \to X$ we say {\em $f$ flattens $p$} if
\begin{itemize}
\item $p  = p  f$
\item For any $g,h$, we have $ g =_p h \imp g =_f h$
\end{itemize}

A map $d : \I^n \to \N$, is a {\em string diagram} if

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] For any $i \in \N$, if $\pi_i x \in \{0,1\}$, then $d(x) \le i$.
\item[2.] For every $x\in \I^n$ with $d(x) = m$, there exists an open neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ in $\I^n$
and a map $f_x : U_x \to U_x$ such that $f_x$ flattens $\pi_{\ge m}\adjust_{U_x} : U_x \to R_{m}$,
and
\[ \forall y \in U_x . (f_x y = y) \iff (d(y) = m)\]
\end{itemize}

A string diagram is a {\em tree diagram} if we also have

\begin{itemize}
\item[3.] For every $x \in \I^n$ with $d(x) = m + 1$, there exists a map $g_x : V_x \to V_x$, where
$V_x = \{ y \in U_x \st \pi_m y \ge \pi_m f_x y \}$, such that $g_x$ flattens $\pi_{\ge m} \adjust_{V_x} : V_x \to R_m$,
and
\[ \forall y \in V_x . (g_x y = y) \iff (f_x y = y \lor d(y) = m)\]

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Attempt 22}

Reading Todd Trimble's thoughts on surface diagrams, I think the above
is still vulnerable to the `Reidemeister I equivalence' problem.
Here's an attempt to dodge it.

Let $V, X$ be topological spaces, let $C$ be a set, and
assume $V$ has a commutative group structure $(+,0,-)$.
A map $P : V \x X \to C$ is called
{\em flat} at the point $(v,x) \in V\x X$ if there
exists
\begin{itemize}
\item  an open neighborhood $U_V \x U_X \subseteq V \x X$ containing $(v,x)$
\item  a continuous map $f : U_X \to U_V$
\end{itemize}
such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $f(x) = v$
\item $\forall (w, y) \in U_V \x U_X. P(f(y) + w - v, y) = P( w, x)$
\end{itemize}

Let $[n] = \{0,\ldots, n\}$ and $\I = [0,1]$. We say {\em surface diagram} of dimension $n$
is a map $P : \I^n \to [n]$ that is flat at every $x\in \I^n$ when considered as a map
 $P : \I^{d(x)} \x \I^{n-d(x)} \to [n]$.

\subsection{Attempt 23}

I think the above is still kind of wrong. Let me try to do the full $n$-categories version.

We ask for a collection $C$ of cells and a map $d : C \to \N$ that gives their dimension.
For each $c \in C$ we have a map $\partial_c : \R^{d(c)} \to C$ that gives its `boundary picture'.

Suppose $c \in C$ and $n = d(c)$ and $x \in \R^{n}$ and $c' = \partial_c x$ and $m = d(c')$.
If $x = {\bf 0}$ then we require $c' = c$. Otherwise, we require $m < n$, and that there
exists open neighborhoods of the origin
\[
{\bf 0} \in U_1 \subseteq \R^{n - m}
\qquad
{\bf 0} \in U_2 \subseteq \R^{m }\]
and a function $f : U_1 \to \R^m$, such that
\[ f({\bf 0}) = {\bf 0} \]
\[ \forall (\Delta_1, \Delta_2) \in U_1 \x U_2. \partial_c(x_1 + \Delta_1, x_2 + \Delta_2 + f(\Delta_1) ) = \partial_{c'}(\Delta_2)\]

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{images/cell-pictures.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Attempt 23b}

This is essentially the same definition, I'm just trying to compress it.

If $C$ is a set and $V, V'$ are topological vector spaces, and we have maps $g : V \x V' \to C$ and $h : V' \to C$,
we say a point $(a,a') \in V \x V'$ is {\em flat} for $g$ and $h$ if there exists an open
neighborhood $U \x U' \subseteq V \x V'$ containing the origin and a continuous function $f : U \to V'$
preserving the origin such that
\[ \forall (\delta, \delta') \in U \x U' . g(a + \delta, a' + \delta' + f(\delta))  = h(\delta') \]

A {\em topological $\omega$-category} is $(C : \Set) \x (d : C \to \N) \x (\partial_c : \R^{d(c)} \to C)$
such that for every $c \in C$, for every $x \in \R^{d(c)}$, if we let $c' = \partial_c x$, we have either
\begin{itemize}
\item $x = {\bf 0}$ and $c' = c$; or
\item $d(c') < d(c)$ and $x$ is flat for $\partial_c$ and $\partial_{c'}$
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Attempt 24}

I notice that the above attempts are about baking in demanding local {\em translations} of the
(germ of the) declared boundary of a cell. But I think I should allow more general transformations,
along the lines of the $\I_n \to \I_m$ maps I've thought about before.


Let me punt on defining `good' maps $\R^{m} \x \R^{n-m} \to \R^m$ for
the moment, and assume that I know what I mean. It's allowed to (and in fact required to) `compress away'
the last $n-m$ coordinates, and may not compress any of the other coordinates.

A {\em topological $\omega$-category} is a set $C$, a map $d : C \to \N$, and for every $c\in C$ a map
 $\partial_c : \R^{d(c)} \to C$,
such that for every $c \in C$, for every $x \in \R^{d(c)}$, if we let $c' = \partial_c x$, we have either
\begin{itemize}
\item $x = {\bf 0}$ and $c' = c$; or
\item $d(c') < d(c)$ and there is some `good' map $\pi : \R^{d(c)} \to \R^{d(c')}$ such that
$\partial_c$ and $ \partial_{c'} \o \pi$ agree on an open neighborhood of $x$.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Attempt 25}

Maybe instead of giving a `dimension' to points, I just give the whole space $\R^n$ that they correspond to.

Suppose $\T$ is a subcategory of the category of pointed topological spaces.
A {\em topological $\omega$-category} for $\T$ is a set $C$, a map $D : C \to \T$, and for every $c\in C$ a map
 $\partial_c : D(c) \to C$,
such that for every $c \in C$, for every $x \in D(c)$, if we let $c' = \partial_c x$, we have either
\begin{itemize}
\item $x = {\bf 0}$ and $c' = c$; or
\item There is a morphism $\pi : D(c) \to D(c') \in \T$ such that
$\partial_c$ and $ \partial_{c'} \o \pi $ agree on an open neighborhood of $x$.
\end{itemize}


(Does $\partial$ become a natural transformation $D \to \Delta
C$, if I regard $C$ as a discrete category, and also as an indiscrete
topological space?)

\subsection{Attempt 26}

A {\em topological $\omega$-category} on a category $\D$ is a set $C$
and a map $\Delta  : C \to \D$ and a functor $F : \D \to \Top_0$ and for each
$c \in C$ a map $\partial_c : F\Delta c \to C $, such that for every $c \in C$,
for every $x \in F\Delta c$, if we let $c' = \partial_c x$, we have either
\begin{itemize}
\item $x = {\bf 0}$ and $c' = c$; or
\item There is a morphism $\pi : \Delta c \to \Delta c' \in \D$ such that
$\partial_c$ and $ \partial_{c'} \o F\pi $ agree on an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$.
\end{itemize}
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&U\ar[dl, hookrightarrow]\ar[dr, hookrightarrow]\\
 F\Delta c  \ar[d, "F\pi"']&& F\Delta c\ar[d, "\partial_c"]\\
 F\Delta c' \ar[rr, "\partial_{c'}"'] && C \\
\end{tikzcd}\]

\subsection{Attempt 27}

I blogged about this definition.

An {\em orderly space} is a topological space $X$ together with
countably many binary relations $<_0, <_1, <_2, \ldots$ on $X$. An
{\em orderly map} is a continuous map between orderly spaces that
preserves all the relations.

Any subset of an orderly space inherits an orderly space structure in
the evident way, by taking the subspace topology and restricting the
orders to the subset.

For each $n$ we equip $\R^n$ with an orderly space structure, by saying that
for $x = (x_0, \ldots, x_{n-1}) \in \R^n$ and $y = (y_0, \ldots, y_{n-1}) \in \R^n$
the orders $<_m$ are given by
\[ x <_m y \iff (m \ge n) \lor (x_m < y_m \land \forall i \ge m . x_i = y_i )\]


 A {\em prespace} is a set $C$ and a map $d : C \to \N$ and for each $c \in C$ a map
$\partial_c : \R^n \to C$. A {\em picture} in a prespace is a map $\R^n \to C$. A picture $P$ is {\em good
at a point} $x \in \R^n$, written $P[x]$, if there exists an open neighborhood $U\subseteq \R^n $ of $x$ and an orderly
map $\pi : U \to \R^{d(P(x))}$ such that
\[\pi(x) = 0 \land \forall y \in U . P(x) = \partial_{P(x)}(\pi(y))\]

A {\em space} is a prespace $(C, d, \partial)$ such that for every $c \in C$ and every $x \in \R^{d(c)}$,
we have

\[ (x = 0\land \partial_c(x) = c) \lor \partial_c[x] \]

\subsubsection{Results}
If $x \in \R^n$ and $y \in \R_{> 0}^n$, define the closed box of radius $y$ around $x$
\[B(x \pm y) = \prod_{i = 0}^{n-1} [x_i-y_i, x_i+y_i] \]
and the $m^{th}$-dimensional extrema of this box by
\[B(x \pm y; m) = \{z \in B(x\pm y) \st z_m \in  \{x_m-y_m, x_m+y_m\}\} \]

Let $[y]_m$ be the first $m$ coordinates of $y$, replacing the rest with zeroes:
\[ [y]_m = (y_0, \ldots, y_{m-1}, 0,  \ldots, 0)\]
I want to try to prove the following lemmas:

\begin{lemma}
Suppose we have a picture $P : \R^n \to C$ that's good at a point $x \in \R^n$.
Then there exists $y\in \R_{> 0}^n$ such that for all $m \in 1,\ldots, n$, we have
 $\forall z \in B(x\pm [y]_m) . z\ne x \imp  d(P(z )) < m$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\cqed
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
Suppose we have a picture $P : \R^n \to C$ that's good at a point $x \in \R^n$.
Then there exists $y\in \R_{> 0}^n$ such that for all $m \in 0,\ldots, n-1$, we have
 $\forall z \in B(x\pm y; m) . d(P(z)) \le m$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For $n = 0$ there is nothing to prove.

For $n = 1$, we have a picture $P : \R \to C$  that's good at $x \in \R$.
We must find $y \in \R_{> 0}$ such that $\forall z \in \{x-y, x+y\}. d(P(z)) = 0$.

For $n = 2$, we have a picture $P : \R^2 \to C$ that's good at $(x_0,x_1) \in \R^2$.
That means we can find a box $B(x \pm y)$ that resembles $\partial_{P(x)}$.
\cqed
\end{proof}

\section{Bitopologies Again}

A bitopological space is a set $X$ equipped with two topologies, call them $L, R \subseteq \ps(X)$.
Maps between bitopologies are continuous if they're continuous according to both $L$ and $R$.

The directed real line $\R$ is the set of reals $\R$
 equipped with the bitopology where bases for the $L$- and $R$-topologies can
be given by
\[ L \supseteq \{ [a,b) \st a,b\in [0,1], a < b \} \qquad R \supseteq \{ (a,b] \st a, b, \in [0,1], a < b \} \]
The directed interval $\I$ has the subspace bitopology for the subset $[0,1]$.



\begin{lemma}
A subset of $\R$ is open (in the usual topology) iff it is $L$-open and $R$-open.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $U$ is open. Let $x$ be given. We want to find an $L$-interval around $x$ that lies
in $U$. Since $U$ is open, we can find $a,b$ such that $x \in (a, b) \subseteq U$. In that case,
$x \in [x,b)\subseteq U$. Reason symmetrically for $R$.

Suppose in the other direction $U$ is $L$-open and $R$-open. Let $x$ be given. We want to find an open
neighborhood of $x$. By $L$-openness, we find $x \in [a_\ell, b_\ell) \subseteq U$, and by $R$-openness, we
find $x \in (a_r, b_r] \subseteq U$. In that case $x \in (a_r, b_\ell) \subseteq U$.
\cqed
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
A function $\R \to \R$ is continuous (as a map between bitopological spaces) if and only if it's
continuous (as an ordinary map between topological spaces) and monotone, i.e. $x \le y$ implies $f(x) \le f(y)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
$\imp$: Suppose $f^{-1}$ takes $L$-open to $L$-open sets, and $R$-open to $R$-open sets.
Then $f^{-1}$ takes open sets to open sets by the previous lemma, and $f$ is at least continuous.

For any $t$, consider the set of points
\[ \{ \phi \st \phi \ge f(t) \}  = [f(t), \infty) \]
It is clearly an $L$-open set. So its inverse image under $f$
\[ \{ u \st f(u) \ge f(t) \}   \]
should also be $L$-open. Surely $t$ itself belongs to this set. So there exists an $L$-open interval
$[t, b)$ such that $\forall u . u \in [t, b) \imp f(u) \ge f(t)$. Symmetrically, using $R$-continuity,
we get an interval $(a, t]$ such that $\forall s . s \in (a, t] \imp f(s) \le f(t)$.
Putting these together we have an interval $(a, b)$ containing $t$ such that everything left of $t$
has a smaller $f$-value, and everything to the right of it has a bigger $f$ value. Since the closed
interval $[x,y]$ is compact, we can find a finite subcover of these `locally monotone' patches, and
conclude that $f(x) \le f(y)$.

$\Leftarrow$:
Suppose $f$ is continuous in the ordinary sense, and monotone. Then note that the inverse image of any point
must be closed, and convex, so it must be a closed interval (including the possibility that it's a point).
Let some $L$-open interval $[a,b)$ be given.
We need to show that its inverse image
\[ f^{-1}([a,b)) = \{ x \st a \le f(x) < b \} \]
is $L$-open. Let some particular $x \in f^{-1}([a,b))$, be given. Now
if $x > a$, we're basically already done. There's an open
neighborhood around $x$ in the codomain, and so $f$'s ordinary
continuity takes it back to an open neighborhood of $x$. Let's think about the remaining case.
Given an $x$ and a $b > f(x)$, we need to show there's a $c > x$ such that the image
of $[x, c)$ lies entirely in $[f(x), b)$. But this is easy: set $c$ to be the left endpoint of the closed
interval that is the inverse image of $b$. Reason symmetrically to show $R$-continuity.
\cqed
\end{proof}

\subsection{Higher Dimensions}
Here's how I deal with $n$ dimensions. Say a {\em polytopology} is a set equipped
with countably many pairs of topologies, call them $L_i, R_i \subseteq \ps(X)$ for $i \in \N$.
Say a function is polycontinuous if it is continuous according to all topologies.

Recall that we have relations $<_m$ defined in the `orderly' structure on $\R^n$.
\[ x <_m y \iff (m \ge n) \lor (x_m < y_m \land \forall i \ge m . x_i = y_i )\]

Define
\[ [a, b)_i = \{z \st a \le_i z <_i b \} \]
\[ (a, b]_i = \{z \st a <_i z \le_i b \} \]
We can then define bases $\hat L_i, \hat R_i$ for topologies $L_i, R_i$ on $\R^n$ by saying
\[ \hat L_i = \{ U \cap [a, b)_i \st a <_i b \in \R^n, U \in \O(\R^n)\} \]
\[ \hat R_i = \{ U \cap (a, b]_i \st a <_i b \in \R^n, U \in \O(\R^n)\} \]

Then we should find
\begin{lemma}
A subset of $\R^n$ is open in the usual sense if it is open with respect to all $L_i, R_i$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For $i \ge m$ we have that $L_i$ and $R_i$ coincide with the usual topology $\O$ on $\R^n$.
So we need only show that $U \subseteq \R^n$ is open in $\O$ iff it is open with respect to all
the topologies in
\[ \{L_i, R_i \st 0 \le i < n\} \]
$\imp$: Suppose $U$ really is open in $\O$. We must show that it's open in $L_i$. Pick a point
$x \in U$, and we can easily find a $b$ also in $U$ such that $x <_i b$, and then $U \cap [x, b)_i$
is a basic open set in $L_i$ contained in $U$ and containing $x$. Reason symmetrically about $R_i$.

$\Leftarrow$: Suppose $U$ is open in all $L_i, R_i$. Let some $x$ be given. We must have witnesses
$U^L_i, a^L_i, b^L_i, U^R_i, a^R_i, b^R_i$ such that
\[ x \in  U^L_i \cap [a^L_i, b^L_i)_i \subseteq U\]
\[ x \in  U^R_i \cap (a^R_i, b^R_i]_i \subseteq U \]
then also we can see
\[ x \in  U^L_i \cap [x, b^L_i)_i \subseteq U\]
\[ x \in  U^R_i \cap (a^R_i, x]_i \subseteq U \]
and so
\[ x \in  U^L_i \cap U^R_i \cap (a^R_i, b^L_i)^{x}_i \subseteq U\]
if we write $(a^R_i, b^L_i)^{x}_i = (a^R_i,x]_i \cup [x, b^L_i)_i $.

Now $\bigcap_i U^L_i \cap U^R_i$ is open, so contains some finite box $V = \prod_i (c_i, d_i)$ around $x$.
So we know
\[ x \in  V \cap (a^R_i, b^L_i)^x_i \subseteq U\]
But now observe that
\[\bigcup_i (a^R_i, b^L_i)^x_i \supseteq \prod_i (a^R_{ii}, b^L_{ii})\]
so we have an open box around $x$ contained in $U$, as required.
\cqed
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
A map $f : \R^n \to \R^m$ is polycontinuous iff it is continuous and weakly orderly, that is, $x \le_i y$ implies
$f(x) \le_i f(y)$ for all $i$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
$\imp$: Suppose $f$ is continuous with respect to all $L_i, R_i$. It is continuous by previous lemma.

$\Leftarrow$:
\cqed
\end{proof}
