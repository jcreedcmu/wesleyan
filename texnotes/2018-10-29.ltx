\section{A Little (Topo)logical Lemma}

\begin{lemma}
Let $U(i), C(i), V$ be propositions.
If
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(C(i), V \prov U(i)\)
\item \( C(i), U(i) \prov V \)
\item \(\prov \exists i.C(i)\)
\end{enumerate}
then
\[V \prequiv \forall i . C(i) \imp U(i) \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The forward direction  follows from $(1)$.
Backwards, use $(3)$ to produce $i$ be given such that $C(i)$.
By assumption $\forall i . C(i) \imp U(i)$, also $U(i)$. Thus $(2)$ yields $V$.
\cqed
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
Suppose we have a topological space $X$ with $V \subseteq X$ and a
finite collection of closed sets $C_1,\ldots,C_n \subseteq X$
and open sets $U_1, \ldots, U_n \subseteq X$ such that
\[\bigcup_i C_i = X\]
\[V \cap C_i = U_i \cap C_i\]
Then $V$ is open.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
By previous lemma,
\[V = \bigcap_i (\bar C_i \cup U_i)\]
Observe that $V$ is open because $C_i$ is closed and $n$ is finite.
\cqed
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Suppose we have $X$ with $V \subseteq X$ and a finite closed cover $C_1,\ldots,C_n$ as before.
Suppose $Y$ is another topological space, and $\pi : X \to Y$ a function, not necessarily
continuous. Let $\nu_i : C_i \to X$ be the inclusion of the subset topology on $C_i$
into the space $X$. If $\pi \o \nu_i$ is continuous for all $i$, then $\pi$ is continuous.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let an open subset $U\subseteq Y$ be given.
Since $\pi \o \nu_i$ is continuous, we know that  $\nu_i^{-1}(\pi^{-1}(U)) = \pi^{-1}(U) \cap C_i $ is open
in the subset topology of $C_i$. Which means that for each $i$ there exists an open set $U_i$ of $X$
such that $\pi^{-1}(U) \cap C_i = U_i \cap C_i$. By previous lemma, $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is open.
\cqed
\end{proof}

\section{Textures}

A {\em texture} $\X$ in $\C$ is a subcategory $\X$ of $\C$, together with $J$ a Grothendieck topology on $\X$.
An {\em $\X$-structure} on an object $C \in \C$ is a subset $\sigma$ of the `maximal $\X$-sieve on $C$,'
by which we mean
$\{ \pi : X \to C \st X \in \X \}$.  Note that $C$ doesn't necessarily belong to $\X$.
When $f \in \sigma$ we say $f$ is `smooth' according to $\sigma$.
We require
\begin{enumerate}
\item (\textbf{Restriction}) If $\pi : X\to C$ is smooth, and $f : Y \to X \in \X$, then $\pi \o f : Y \to C$ is smooth.
\item (\textbf{Amalgamation}) If $\pi : X\to C$ is a function, and $S$ is a $J$-covering sieve on $X$,
and $\pi \o f : Y \to C$ is smooth for every $f : Y \to X \in S$, then $\pi$ is smooth.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Continuity Texture}

Here's an example of a texture. Set $\C = \X = \mathbf{Top}$.
If $S$ is a sieve on a topological space $X$, say that a not-necessarily-open subset $V \subseteq X$
is {\em $S$-open} if for any $f : Y \to X \in S$ we have $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open subset of $Y$.

We give a grothendieck topology $J$ by saying a sieve $S$ on a space $X$ is covering
when every $V \subseteq X$ that is $S$-open is in fact open.

Let's check this is a Grothendieck topology.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The maximal sieve $M_X$ should cover $X$. If a subset $V$ is $M_X$-open, then
also we can observe $\rid^{-1}(V)$ is open, since $\id_X \in M_X$. So the maximal sieve counts as covering.
\item Intersections of covering sieves should cover. Let $S, S'$ be given.
The condition `$S$ covers and $S'$ covers' should be the same
as `$S \cap S'$ covers'.
The former is

\[ (\O_S \subseteq \O)\land(\O_{S'} \subseteq \O) \]
and the latter
\[ \O_{S \cap S'} \subseteq \O \]
So I want to check that
\[ \O_{S \cap S'} = \O_{S} \cup  \O_{S'}\]
i.e.
\[ \forall f \in S \cap S' . \ldots \prequiv (\forall f \in {S} . \ldots) \cup  (\forall f \in {S'} . \ldots)\]

Suppose we know that $S \cap S'$ is covering. Then surely $S$ is covering and $S'$ covering just by monotonicity.
The bigger an $S$ is, the harder it is for $f$ to be $S$-open, and the easier it is for $S$ to be covering.
Suppose $S$ and $S'$ are both covering. We want to show that $S \cap S'$ is covering. That is,
for every $f \in S \cap S'$ that if $f^{-1}(V)$ is open, then $V$ is open.

Hm, maybe this isn't a Grothendieck topology at all, but some weaker notion of covering.
\end{enumerate}
