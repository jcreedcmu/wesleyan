braids
======

The idea here is to interpret the crossing

    \ /
     /
    / \

as a permutation on 2n things; each strand of a braid group
corresponds to n things. We want to find which such permutations
are actually compatible with Reidemeister's 3rd law,

	\ /  |     |  \ /
	 \   |     |   \
	/ \  |     |  / \
	|  \ /     \ /  |
	|   \   =   \   |
	|  / \     / \  |
	\ /  |     |  \ /
	 \   |     |   \
	/ \  |     |  / \
